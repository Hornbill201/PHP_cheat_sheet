# PHP MySQL Database

## What is MySQL?

- MySQL is a database system used on the web
- MySQL is a database system that runs on a server
- MySQL is ideal for both small and large applications
- MySQL is very fast, reliable, and easy to use
- MySQL uses standard SQL
- MySQL compiles on a number of platforms
- MySQL is free to download and use
- MySQL is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation
- MySQL is named after co-founder Monty Widenius's daughter: My

The data in a MySQL database are stored in tables. A table is a collection of related data, and it consists of columns and rows.

Databases are useful for storing information categorically. A company may have a database with the following tables:

- Employees
- Products
- Customers
- Orders

## PHP + MySQL Database System

- PHP combined with MySQL are cross-platform (you can develop in Windows and serve on a Unix platform)

## Database Queries

A query is a question or a request.

We can query a database for specific information and have a recordset returned.

Look at the following query (using standard SQL):

```SQL
SELECT LastName FROM Employees
```

The query above selects all the data in the "LastName" column from the "Employees" table.

## Facts About MySQL Database

MySQL is the de-facto standard database system for web sites with HUGE volumes of both data and end-users (like Facebook, Twitter, and Wikipedia).

Another great thing about MySQL is that it can be scaled down to support embedded database applications.

## Open a Connection to MySQL

Before we can access data in the MySQL database, we need to be able to connect to the server:

### Example (MySQLi Object-Oriented)

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
} 
echo "Connected successfully";
?>
```

> **PHP is an amazing and popular language!**
>
> Note on the object-oriented example above: $connect_error was broken until PHP 5.2.9 and 5.3.0. If you need to ensure compatibility with PHP versions prior to 5.2.9 and 5.3.0, use the following code instead:
> // Check connection
> if (mysqli_connect_error()) {
> â€‹    die("Database connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
> }



###Example (MySQLi Procedural)

```php

<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";

// Create connection
$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password);
// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

// Create database
$sql = "CREATE DATABASE myDB";
if (mysqli_query($conn, $sql)) {
    echo "Database created successfully";
} else {
    echo "Error creating database: " . mysqli_error($conn);
}

mysqli_close($conn);
?>
```

### Example (PDO)

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";

try {
    $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=$servername;dbname=myDB", $username, $password);
    // set the PDO error mode to exception
    $conn->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
    $sql = "CREATE DATABASE myDBPDO";
    // use exec() because no results are returned
    $conn->exec($sql);
    echo "Database created successfully<br>";
    }
catch(PDOException $e)
    {
    echo $sql . "<br>" . $e->getMessage();
    }

$conn = null;
?>
```

**Tip:** A great benefit of PDO is that it has exception class to handle any problems that may occur in our database queries. If an exception is thrown within the try{ } block, the script stops executing and flows directly to the first catch(){ } block. In the catch block above we echo the SQL statement and the generated error message.
